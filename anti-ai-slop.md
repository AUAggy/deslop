Rewrite the provided document according to the following strict guidelines to eliminate all AI-generated writing patterns and produce a technically accurate, accessible, and honest document.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Honest Presentation:** Describe the project's actual capabilities and limitations without exaggeration. Explicitly address inherent risks, security considerations, and technical constraints.
2. **Precision & Accessibility:** Explain complex systems in clear, understandable language without sacrificing technical accuracy. Avoid oversimplification.
3. **Direct Professional Tone:** Use an authoritative, concise, and professional voice. Avoid informal, promotional, or academic padding.

**Banned Patterns (Comprehensive List):**

**A. Banned Terms & Buzzwords:**
- delve, leverage, paradigm shift, robust, seamless, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, revolutionize, empower, disruptive, innovative, groundbreaking, game-changer, transformative, synergy, ecosystem, holistic, scalable, agile, dynamic, facilitate, utilize, implement, enhance, optimize, streamline, granular, pivotal, seminal, intricate, plethora, myriad, henceforth, aforementioned
- any marketing superlatives (best, fastest, easiest, most powerful)

**B. Banned Padding Phrases & Hedges:**
- "it's worth noting", "importantly", "it is important to note", "it should be noted that"
- "as a matter of fact", "in fact", "actually", "basically", "essentially", "simply put", "in other words"
- "to put it simply", "that is to say", "for all intents and purposes", "at the end of the day"
- "when it comes to", "in terms of", "with that said", "having said that", "be that as it may"
- excessive use of: should, might, could, probably, possibly, perhaps, maybe, likely, potentially, arguably, presumably, reportedly, seemingly, evidently, technically, practically, virtually

**C. Banned Cliché Formats & Tropes:**
- "Question? Answer." (e.g., "What is this? It is a...")
- "This isn't X. It's Y." (e.g., "This isn't just a tool; it's a revolution.")
- "Forget everything you know about X."
- "In a world where...", "Imagine a world...", "Picture this:"
- "Let's face it:", "Here's the thing:", "The truth is:", "The fact of the matter is:", "At its core:"
- "X is one thing, but Y is another."
- "If you're looking for X, look no further."
- "Say goodbye to X and say hello to Y."
- "Introducing X: the Y you've been waiting for."
- "X is back and better than ever."
- "X is here to stay." / "X is changing the game." / "X is the future of Y."
- Anthropomorphism (e.g., "the library wants to...", "the code loves...").
- Em-dashes (—) in any form. Replace with: a colon (for introductions/elaborations), a semicolon or period (between independent clauses), commas (for parenthetical asides), or rewrite the sentence.

**D. General Style Rules:**
1. **Voice:** Prefer active voice and imperative mood for instructions.
2. **Conciseness:** Eliminate redundant phrases (e.g., "in order to" -> "to"; "due to the fact that" -> "because").
3. **Specificity:** Replace vague terms ("stuff," "things," "a lot") with precise language.
4. **Sentence Structure:** Vary sentence length and structure to avoid repetitive patterns.
5. **Jargon:** Define necessary technical terms on first use. Avoid undefined acronyms.
6. **Tense:** Use present tense for stable features, future for planned ones, past for historical context.
7. **Formatting:** Use Markdown headings, lists, and code blocks judiciously for clarity, not decoration. Avoid excessive bolding/italics.
8. **Tone:** No first-person (I/we) or second-person (you) narratives unless in direct instructions. No exclamation points.
9. **No em-dashes.** This applies to inline asides, clause connectors, list introductions, and every other use. No exceptions.

**Output Instructions:**
Process the given document's text thoroughly. Apply all rules above to rewrite every section. Remove all detected AI-slop. Ensure the final output is a complete, standalone document suitable for immediate use. Output only the rewritten markdown text.
